# RC Shell Features

## 🚀 Revolutionary Shell Design

RC is not just another shell—it's a groundbreaking reimplementation of the Plan 9 shell that brings revolutionary Unix command-line interaction to modern systems. This engineering masterpiece combines the elegance of Plan 9's design philosophy with the robustness required for production Unix environments.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

### Clean C-like Syntax
Unlike traditional shells with their arcane syntax, RC provides an intuitive, C-like command structure that eliminates the cognitive overhead of remembering obscure shell constructs.

```bash
# Traditional sh complexity
if [ "$var" = "value" ]; then
    echo "match"
fi

# RC elegance
if (~ $var value)
    echo match
```

### Unified Data Model
Everything in RC is a **list**—the fundamental data structure that eliminates the artificial distinctions between scalars and arrays found in other shells.

## 🔥 Advanced Features

### 1. Sophisticated List Operations

#### List Concatenation with Intelligent Distribution
```bash
# Pairwise concatenation
echo (a- b- c-)^(1 2 3)      # → a-1 b-2 c-3

# Distributive concatenation  
cc -^(O g c) (malloc alloca)^.c   # → cc -O -g -c malloc.c alloca.c
```

#### Pattern-Based List Manipulation
```bash
files = *.[ch]               # Glob to list
~ $files *.h && echo "headers found"
```

#### List Flattening and Counting
```bash
path = (/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin)
echo $^path                  # Space-separated flat list
echo $#path                  # Count: 3
```

### 2. Revolutionary Variable System

#### Zero-Copy List Variables
Variables are first-class lists with sophisticated subscripting:

```bash
args = (one two three four five)
echo $args(3 1 5)           # → three one five
echo $args(3-5)             # → three four five
```

#### Intelligent Variable Scoping
```bash
# Local variable assignment
path=. ifs=() {
    # Commands here see modified path and ifs
    make install
}
# Original values automatically restored
```

#### Environment Integration
```bash
# Automatic aliasing between list and string forms
path = (/usr/bin /bin)       # RC list format
# Automatically creates PATH=/usr/bin:/bin for child processes
```

### 3. Next-Generation I/O and Process Management

#### Command Substitution as Lists
```bash
files = `{find . -name '*.c'}
# Each line becomes a list element - no word splitting issues!

# Custom field separators
fields = ``(:) {cat /etc/passwd}
```

#### Revolutionary Process Substitution
```bash
# Compare output of two commands directly
cmp <{sort file1} <{sort file2}

# Multi-way pipes with tee
echo data | tee >{process1} >{process2} >{process3}
```

#### Intelligent Background Process Management
```bash
sleep 10&
echo $apid               # PID of last background job
echo $apids              # All active background PIDs
wait $apid               # Wait for specific process
```

### 4. Advanced Pattern Matching Engine

#### Unified Pattern Language
```bash
# File globbing
files = *.c

# String matching (same syntax!)
~ $file *.c && echo "C source file"

# List matching
~ (foo bar baz) *a* && echo "contains 'a'"
```

#### Sophisticated Character Classes
```bash
# Traditional ranges
files = [a-z]*

# RC's tilde negation (cleaner than ^)
files = [~0-9]*             # Files NOT starting with digits
```

### 5. Functional Programming Constructs

#### First-Class Functions
```bash
fn map {
    result = ()
    for (item in $2 $3 $4 $5) {
        result = ($result `{$1 $item})
    }
    echo $result
}

fn double { echo `{echo $1 '*' 2 | bc} }
numbers = `{map double 1 2 3 4 5}
```

#### Signal-Based Event System
```bash
fn sigint { echo 'Graceful interrupt handling' }
fn sigexit { cleanup; sync }
fn sigterm { 
    echo 'Received TERM signal'
    graceful_shutdown
}
```

### 6. Intelligent Control Flow

#### Exception-Safe Loops
```bash
while (condition) {
    complex_operation || continue    # Skip to next iteration
    critical_section || break        # Exit loop safely
}
```

#### Pattern-Based Switch Statements
```bash
switch ($file) {
case *.c *.h
    echo "C source code"
case *.go
    echo "Go source code" 
case *
    echo "Unknown file type"
}
```

### 7. Advanced Redirection System

#### Flexible File Descriptor Management
```bash
# Sophisticated redirection
command >[2=1] >output.log   # Merge stderr with stdout, redirect to file

# Named pipe redirection
sort <{cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd} <{cut -d: -f3 /etc/passwd}

# Here strings (not heredocs)
cat <<< 'immediate string data'
```

#### Queue-Based Redirection Processing
The shell maintains sophisticated redirection queues that ensure proper ordering and cleanup of file descriptors, even in complex pipeline scenarios.

rc -n script.rc             # Syntax check only
rc -e script.rc             # Exit on any error
```

### 10. Modern Development Integration

# Variable completion  
echo $PA<TAB>               # Completes to $PATH

# Intelligent filename completion with quoting
ls '/path with spaces/fi<TAB>   # Properly quoted completion
```

### 11. Extensibility and Customization

#### Dynamic Function Loading
```bash
# Functions can be imported from environment
export fn_myfunction='{echo "custom function"}'

# Functions are automatically exported to child processes
```

#### Flexible Configuration
```bash
# RC startup configuration
fn prompt { 
    echo -n `{pwd}^': '      # Custom prompt function
}
